Fire Hazard is a remote controlled walking and balancing device to allow for the user to simply drop it in tight spaces and crevices to then allow for observation and information gathering. It uses an HM10 module to send and receive controller data to your phone. That too is password protected in order to keep the robot only working for the creating user. It can also activate a balance mode to keep it facing upwards by bending each of its 4 legs in perfect angles. It does this by using an MPU6050 and calculating the angle changes on it. Its overall format is a 4 legged spider with 3D printed parts and about 12 servos.
